# Real-Time-Dashboard-
This project is a real-time dashboard built using Angular, Node.js, Socket.IO, and MySQL. It allows users to view and monitor data in real-time as it is updated in a MySQL database.

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install in the project root directory.
Start the server by running node app.js.
Start the Angular app by running ng serve in another terminal window.
Open the app in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:4200.

# Usage
By running the application and accessing the dashboard, you should be able to see real-time updates of the data retrieved from the MySQL database.

Note: Make sure you have a MySQL database set up and running with the appropriate configuration (host, username, password, database name) as specified in the app.js file. Also, ensure that you have installed the required dependencies by running npm install in the project root directory.

Feel free to customize the application and its usage instructions according to your specific needs.

# Technologies
1 Angular: Angular is a popular front-end framework for building web applications using TypeScript. It provides a structured approach to application development and offers features such as data binding, component-based architecture, and dependency injection.

2 Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it suitable for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

3 Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools for building web applications, including routing, middleware support, and template rendering.

4 Socket.IO: Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients (browsers) and servers. It uses WebSockets as the primary communication protocol but can fall back to other techniques, such as long polling, if WebSockets are not available.

5 MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for storing and managing structured data. In your project, you're using the mysql2 package, which is a MySQL client for Node.js.

6 Cors: cors is a middleware package that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Express.js application. It allows your server to handle requests from different domains or origins.

7 HTML, CSS: These are the fundamental languages for building web pages and styling them. They are used in conjunction with Angular templates and stylesheets to create the user interface of your application.
